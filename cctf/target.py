DESCRIPTION
----------------
This module provides a target object to represent a remote device. A target can
be a server or any other connectable device. 

A target object represents a remote host or any device that can be connected or
logged in.  A target object is created by calling the factory method
'gettarget()' of targetfactory module. A CCTF script can create multiple target
objects to connect to multiple remote devices and run commands on them
simultaneously.

A target object can create multiple shell objects associated on it. A shell
object is created by calling the target.newshell() method. A shell object
represents a connected pseudo terminal (pty) on the target. The caller then
invoke shell.exe() to run commands on the target. 
        
EXAMPLE
----------------
    # create a target object 
    target = gettarget("10.1.0.96", "root", "password") 

    # create a shell object associated on the target 
    shell  = target.newshell()
    
    # run a command on the target 
    shell.exe("banner Hello CCTF!")

    # reboot the target then wait for it to be online 
    target.reboot()

    # upload a file to the target 
    target.upload("local_file", "remote_file")
    
    # download a file from the target 
    target.download("local_file", "remote_file")

        DESCRIPTION:
        ----------------
        A target object represents a remote host or any device that can be
        connected or logged in.  
        
        A target object is created by calling the factory method 'gettarget()'
        of targetfactory module. A CCTF script can create multiple target
        objects to connect to multiple remote devices and run commands on them
        simultaneously.
    
        A target object can create multiple shell objects associated on it. A
        shell object is created by calling the target.newshell() method. A shell
        object represents a connected pseudo terminal (pty) on the target. The
        caller then invoke shell.exe() to run commands on the target. 

        The target object itself has a internal shell object. The target object
        provides some useful methods through the internal shell object:
        
        1. reboot: caller can reboot() or panicreboot() or panic() the target.
        2. file transfer: caller can upload() or download() files to/from the
           target.
        3. wait for online or offline: caller can wait_alive() or wait_down()
           the target.
        4. checking avilibility: caller can check if the target is alive by
           calling alive().
        5. information: caller can get the hostname of the target by calling
           gethostname().
        
        The 'Target class' is an abstract class. It is the base class of all
        kinds of real devices. For example, a server with Linux OS is
        represented by a 'LinuxTarget' object, a server with Windows OS is
        represented by a 'WindowsTarget' object, a switch is represented by a
        'SwitchTarget' object, etc.
